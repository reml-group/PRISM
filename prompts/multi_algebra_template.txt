Your goal is to write a mathematical equation and generate the answer format
starting with 'output ='.

Below is an example,
input: Qt: at a restaurant, each adult meal costs A and kids eat free. if a group of B people
came in and C were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
output = 5*(15-8)

one more example,
Qt: At the fair Adam bought A tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had B tickets left. If each ticket cost
C dollars, how much money did Adam spend riding the ferris wheel?
output = (10-2)*8

input: {input}
