Your goal is to write a Python function that returns the value to the variable answer.

An example is,
input: at a restaurant, each adult meal costs A and kids eat free. if a group of B people
came in and C were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
output:
def get_result(A, B, C):
    out = A*(B-C)
    return out
answer = get_result(5, 15, 8)

One more example is,
input: Qt: At the fair Adam bought A tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had B tickets left. If each ticket cost
C dollars, how much money did Adam spend riding the ferris wheel?
output:
def get_result(A, B, C):
    out = A*(B-C)
    return out
answer = get_result(10, 2, 8)

input: {input}
output:
